Strings, and functions that work on them.

* 4 Strings and Characters
************************

A string in Emacs Lisp is an array that contains an ordered sequence of
characters.  Strings are used as names of symbols, buffers, and files;
to send messages to users; to hold text being copied between buffers;
and for many other purposes.  Because strings are so important, Emacs
Lisp has many functions expressly for manipulating them.  Emacs Lisp
programs use strings more often than individual characters.

   *Note Strings of Events::, for special considerations for strings of
keyboard character events.
