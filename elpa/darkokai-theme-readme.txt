This theme and particular the structure of this file is entirely based
on the great work by `oneKelvinSmith' and his port of the monokai theme
found at https://github.com/oneKelvinSmith/monokai-emacs.

Darkokai arose after I found myself making more and more small tweaks
to monokai via a separate theme overrides file. Eventually it made more
sense to create a new theme as it was diverging significantly from the
original theme.

Pull requests, and suggestions are most welcome!
