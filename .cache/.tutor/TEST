                    Lesson 5.3: A SELECTIVE WRITE COMMAND


           ** To save part of the file, type  :#,# w FILENAME  **

  1. Once again, type  :!ls  or  :!dir  to obtain a listing of your directory
     and choose a suitable filename such as TEST.

  2. Move the cursor to the top of this lesson by pressing  C-k  to find the
     number of that line.  REMEMBER THIS NUMBER!

  3. Now move to the bottom of the lesson by pressing  C-j  to find the
     number of that line. REMEMBER THIS LINE NUMBER ALSO!

  4. To save ONLY a section to a file, type   :#,# w TEST   where #,# are
     the two numbers you remembered (top,bottom) and TEST is your filename.

  5. Again, see that the file is there with  :!ls  or  :!dir  but DO NOT
     remove it.
