2. Determin which of the three options you will use to run the aircrack-ng suit
3. Get started using the aircrack-ng suit

decide which method :
1. linux 
2. Live CD
3. VMWare
** determing the Wireless Card Chipset
*** Tutorial: Is my Wireless Card Compatible
**** introduction
supports cards

on to the matter at hand. here are the steps we will be follow:
***** Determin your requirements and constraints
****** Which operating system you plan to use
window can not inject data packets. far fewer cards compatible.
linux gives you the ability to both listen to and inject packets.
****** Your preferred hardware format(PCI, PCMCIA, USB, etc.)
****** Which features you require(Listening, injection)
***** Learn the basics of a wireless cards
There are two manufacturers involved with wireless cards:
1. the brand of the card itself.
2. who makes the wireless chipset whith the card.
***** Determin the chipset
****** 
- search the internet
- search forum
- look at windows driver file names
- check the card manufacturers page
- physically see the wireless chip
- Federal Communications Commission ID search

- IkiDevi
- Madwifi compatibility list
- Wireless Adapter Chipset Directory
- Atheros 

make sure to include revision/version when doing search.
****** linux
- dmesg
- ISA. out of the luck
- PCI card. 
lspci -nn
- lsusb
- Cardbus card and kernal 2.4x above
lspci -nn
cardctl ident
- Pcmcia card 
kernel 2.6.14 or later:
pccardctl ident
older kernel:
cardctl ident
- lsmod
***** Verify the chipset capabilities
capability section
***** Determin the drivers and patches required
Drivers Section
***** Select card
Compatible card list
*** Compatible Cards
** Linux Distribution of Your Choice
installing drivers
installing aircrack
*** Advantages
1. aircrack-ng is almost certainly guaranteed to work
2. Provides the ability to run the latest versions of aircrack-ng and any wireless driver
3. Provides the most flexibility
*** Disadvantage
Requires much deeper knowledge of linux
** Live CD
** VMWare Image
** Using the Aircrack-ng Suite
*** injection test
**** Description
     the injection test determins if your card can successfully inject and determine the ping response times to the Access Point(AP).
**** Usage
aireplay-ng -9 -e teddy -a mac -i wlan1 wlan
